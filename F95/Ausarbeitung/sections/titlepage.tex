      doctors can have a detailed look inside the human body. In these
      experiments we take a look at how we can transform the data from CT and
      MRT scans into one 3-dimensional picture. As it turns out, the quality
      and computing time of the transformations are highly dependent on a
      variety of parameters, which we had to optimize to get a satisfying
      result.}
